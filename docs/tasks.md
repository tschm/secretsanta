# Secret Santa Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Secret Santa project. Tasks are logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Documentation

1. [ ] Enhance README.md with:
   - Project description and purpose
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Development setup instructions
   - Deployment instructions

2. [ ] Create user documentation explaining how to use the Secret Santa application

3. [x] Add docstrings to all functions in app.py

4. [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors

## Application Functionality

5. [ ] Implement actual Secret Santa pairing functionality (currently only shuffles groups separately)
   - Add logic to pair people from group A with people from group B
   - Ensure no one is paired with themselves if the same name appears in both groups

6. [ ] Add input validation to prevent errors with empty inputs or invalid formats

7. [ ] Improve UI/UX with better formatting and instructions

8. [ ] Add option to export/save pairings (e.g., to CSV or text file)

9. [ ] Add option to send email notifications to participants with their assigned person

## Code Quality

10. [ ] Restructure app.py to follow better code organization:
    - Move imports to the top of the file
    - Create separate functions for different responsibilities
    - Add proper error handling

11. [ ] Fix the import order in app.py (currently imports marimo twice)

12. [ ] Add type hints to all functions

13. [ ] Add meaningful variable names (replace aa, bb with more descriptive names)

## Testing

14. [ ] Create a test directory with a basic test structure

15. [ ] Implement unit tests for the core functionality

16. [ ] Add integration tests for the complete application flow

17. [ ] Set up a GitHub workflow for running tests automatically

## Infrastructure

18. [ ] Fix the Makefile to properly install dependencies from requirements.txt (currently commented out)

19. [ ] Remove unused variables in Makefile (e.g., folder = notebooks)

20. [ ] Add a development requirements file (dev-requirements.txt) for development dependencies

21. [ ] Update Docker healthcheck to be more robust (currently just checks if the server is running)

22. [ ] Add Docker Compose configuration for easier local development

## Security

23. [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent potential security issues

24. [ ] Review Docker image for security vulnerabilities

25. [ ] Implement proper logging for debugging and security auditing

## Performance

26. [ ] Optimize Docker image size further (consider multi-stage builds)

27. [ ] Add caching mechanisms for repeated operations

## Deployment

28. [ ] Create deployment documentation for different environments

29. [ ] Add configuration options for different deployment scenarios

30. [ ] Implement environment variable support for configuration

## Monitoring

31. [ ] Add basic monitoring and health check endpoints

32. [ ] Implement logging for application events and errors

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

33. [ ] Enhance GitHub workflows to include testing

34. [ ] Add automatic deployment to a staging environment

35. [ ] Implement semantic versioning for releases
